# Project Vision

For our project visions, we seek to work as a fluid team that supports one another to develop a piece of work that we are all very proud of at the end of the day. With each of us coming from a different background but all sharing an interest in the dataset, we each have our own perspective on the dataset and method of analysis. We are seeking to synthesize a project that, when analyzed in depth, will provide great insight into the structure of the course, how grades are distributed and what effect the covid-19 pandemic had on schooling. In hindsight we will reflect on this project as a milestone in our pursuits of higher knowledge and allow us recognize the skills we developed along the way.

## Contracted Grade
